# Renjin with dependencies using ant and ivy

This showcases the use of ant (with Ivy) to run renjin.
There is also a simple bash script that compiles and runs "manually" to show the, perhaps, most primitive way
of running a renjin powered program.

## Prerequisites
ant and ivy installed

there is a convenience script to install ivy if you dont have that already (installIvy.sh)

## Build and run
`ant run`

## cleanup
`ant clean`

execute `ant -p` for more tasks
